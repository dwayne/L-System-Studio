# GUI-for-drawing-with-the-L-system-in-Elm

-work in progress-

1. example - Dragon curve: https://i.ibb.co/7K91Nqw/Drag-Cur-Ex.png
2. example - Sierpinski triangle: https://i.ibb.co/vczRP7m/STriEx.png
3. example - Fractal plant: https://i.ibb.co/chsr5KK/FPlantEx.png


Future enchancements include: 

1. Saving and loading L-system presets: Allow users to save and load their L-system configurations, making it easier to revisit and share interesting patterns.
2. Advanced drawing options: 
  2.1 {	   ->      Open a polygon
  2.2 }	   ->      Close a polygon and fill it with fill colour
  2.3 >	   ->      Multiply the line length by the line length scale factor
  2.4 <	   ->      Divide the line length by the line length scale factor
  2.5 &	   ->      Swap the meaning of + and -
  2.6 (	   ->      Decrement turning angle by turning angle increment
  2.7 )	   ->      Increment turning angle by turning angle increment
3. Animation: Add the ability to animate the drawing process, making it more visually engaging and easier to understand how the pattern is formed.
4. User-guided tutorials or examples: Provide example L-systems or step-by-step tutorials to help users get started and understand the capabilities of the application.
5. Adding error handling and input validation.
6. Adding tooltips and help text.
7. Optimizing the code for performance.
